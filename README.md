# The-Russia
The Russia(-nizer) is an extension which finds and replaces mentions of Russia with "The Russia".


The joke is that it's a play on how people used to refer to "The Ukraine", which can be interpreted as a demeaning title for a not real country. Now that things are going so poorly for Russia, especially morally, perhaps they deserve our condescention instead. Included is a webpage to make donating to Ukraine easy, for when you're feeling inspired -- it's right there. :) 


Now that there is a polarizing war which in a small part has to do with the "status" of countries, my extension subverts cultural expectations by applying the "the" to Russia instead. I hope people think twice about the power of small words on how they interpret the web through this app.
