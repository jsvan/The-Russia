# The-Russia
The Russia(-nizer) is an extension which finds and replaces mentions of Russia with "The Russia".


The joke is that it's a play on how people used to refer to "The Ukraine", which is a demeaning title for a not real country. Now that things are going so poorly for Russia, especially morally, perhaps they deserve our condescention instead. Included is a webpage to make donating to Ukraine easy, for when you're feeling inspired -- it's right there. :)
